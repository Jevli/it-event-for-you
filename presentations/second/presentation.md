# Evensi data

Database connection was established on Dec 5th

Since then N events were saved from Evensi

First all events were saved, later we only started to save events that matched one or more keywords

---

# Keywords

We had a list of keywords

Keyword list was constructed by hand, the words were picked up for example from actual Evensi IT events

The list had in total almost a hundred words

Keywords were searched from event name and description

Searching was done with substring matching

---

# Recommendations

Recommendations were calculated by comparing the amount of keywords for an event

Three events with most keywords were recommended

Events could be in Tampere, Helsinki or Turku

# Problems

Daily Evensi quota for the API calls was really small and we maxed it out several times

It slowed our working since we were unable to get all the data when we needed it
